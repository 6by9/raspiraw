Raspiraw: An example app that receives data directly from CSI sensors
on the Raspberry Pi.

The register sets for OV5647 and IMX219 are often under NDA, which means
that support can not be offered over their contents without breaking
those NDAs. Anything added here by RPF/RPT has to be demonstrable as
already being in the public domain, or from 3rd parties having
reverse engineered how the firmware is working (eg by listening to the
I2C communications).
